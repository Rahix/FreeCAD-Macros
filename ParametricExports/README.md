Parametric Export Scripts
=========================
These macros are meant to be a reference for writing your own scripts to export
variants of a parametric model.  You won't be able to make use of them
directly, as they are usually tied to specific project files.  But maybe they
are still useful for various bits of code...

The state of these scripts is quite varying.  I tried adding a few comments to
make them more useful...

Repository of FreeCAD Macros
============================
This is a collection of various FreeCAD macros I have written.

Some have broader use, like the
[`UpsideDownCounterbore`](./UpsideDownCounterbore/) and others are meant more
as a reference for building similar macros for your own needs.

## Overview
- [`UpsideDownCounterbore`](./UpsideDownCounterbore/) â€” Automatically generate
  (fully parametric) geometry for the [overhanging counterbore trick][Df3DP-R3.5].
